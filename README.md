# Prediction-of-Solar-Power-System-Coverage
DeepSolar Project aimed at using high-resolution satellite images and analyzing it to identify the sizes of solar photovoltaic panels installed in each area and to generate a dataset. The binary response variable accounts for number of solar panels installed and is accompanied with features that help describing the social, economic, environmental, geographical, and meteorological aspects of the tile. We preprocess the dataset and apply various supervised machine learning algorithms for training. The accuracy of the trained models is validated, and the best model is selected for this dataset. The Random Forest model is found to be achieving the highest accuracy and can later be used to classify unknown data obtained by DeepSolar project with a reasonable accuracy.
